Rackspace API Challenge

## Rules:

In order to submit your answers for prizes, you must:

 * Create a public github account and push your answers to a new repository with filenames of challenge1, challenge2, etc.
 * Submit your repository by April 10th.

## Information on the Desired Language:

### You are encouraged to use one of the following Software Development Kits (SDK):

 * Pyrax for Python (http://docs.rackspace.com/sdks/guide/content/python.html)
 * jClouds for Java (http://docs.rackspace.com/sdks/guide/content/java.html)
 * PHP-Opencloud (http://docs.rackspace.com/sdks/guide/content/php.html)

### Other Languages which do not have an official Rackspace SDK yet:

 * Ruby
 * .Net
 * Node.js

### Languages that you are strongly encouraged to avoid:

 * Bash

For all challenges, you can assume that a valid credentials file with the username and API key exist at ~/.rackspace_cloud_credentials

Nothing will be graded or judged until the challenge period is over on April 10th. At that time, your repository will be cloned and reviewed.  We will start another challenge period after this one expires on April 10th.
    
## What was that about Prizes?

Over the next few weeks, there will be the opportunity to earn a total of 30 points from the different challenges being sent out.

 * If you earn at least 5 Points: You get a super cool, limited edition, first run "API Savvy" button for your lanyard.
 * If you earn at least 12 Points: You get a $5 gift certificate for Ground Town
 * If you earn at least 20 Points: You'll be invited to an end of challenge celebration! Beer, food, hanging out with your fellow geeks, and MAYBE a special prize. Want to find out what it is? Get to coding!

In addition to using this as an opportunity to grow knowledge around Rackspace, we will also be selecting the best submissions and adding them to a customer facing Code Snippets page. This will be a place customers can go to get example code that solves real life problems.
     
## Questions:

### I'm not a developer. Should I even try this?

Yes! The goal is to get out of your comfort zone and expand your skill set. All of the Rackspace SDKs listed above have a great "Samples" section with code that you can use as a jumping off point. We have created a new internal forum category where you can ask for help and discuss each challenge. Codecademy.com is also a great resource for building a development foundation.
      
### I've never used github, and you scared me with all this talk about repositories, pushing, and cloning.

It's not as scary as it sounds. Check out try.github.com for a quick crash course, and if you can't figure it out, jump into the internal forums above and ask for a hand.  Rackers like to help Rackers, so donâ€™t be afraid to ask questions.
       
### Why can't I use bash?!

The goal of this project is to identify Rackers who have a passion to learn DevOps and grow our knowledge so we can support our customers using the API. The fact is, the majority of our customers using the API do so with advanced languages like Python and Ruby, and not by using curl in bash scripts.
